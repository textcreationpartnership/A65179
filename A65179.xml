            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>This Propoſal and Deſire of the <hi>Countrey,</hi> doth greatly rejoyce the hearts of all <hi>true Proteſtants</hi> in the <hi>City:</hi> We can heartily and readily ſay, <hi>One and All, One and All,</hi> for our <hi>Proteſtant King,</hi> for our <hi>Parliament-Privileges,</hi> for our <hi>Properties,</hi> and for our precious <hi>Proteſtant Religion:</hi> O theſe things are near and dear unto us!

               <p>Truly it is a hard matter to hit upon the right meaning of <hi>Princes;</hi> but as to thoſe words, ſome do think it is a keeping of the Crown in the Royal Family, not ſuffering it to deſcend upon any other Perſons but ſuch as are of the <hi>Regal Race;</hi> and ſome do think it is a forbidding of the <hi>Parliament</hi> to remove any Perſon <hi>whatſoever</hi> from the <hi>Crown,</hi> who by due courſe ought to have it, being in the <hi>Royal Line.</hi>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60474:2"/>this will make our <hi>Countrey</hi> cry out, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> But our hope is, our good <hi>Parliament</hi> will look well to this great matter.

And one of the firſt things that came before them, was a <hi>Dreadful Information</hi> of one Mr. <hi>Dangerfield,</hi> wherein he declared, <hi>How he was concerned with the Lady</hi> Powis, <hi>and the Lord</hi> Peterborough, <hi>in contriving and framing a Plot that ſhould be caſt upon the Presbyterians; and how he was with the Duke of</hi> York <hi>in his Cloſet at</hi> Whitehall, <hi>who gave him great incouragement to proceed in that matter; aſſuring him that the major part of the Gentry in the Northern Parts were his Friends, and were no ſtrangers to this deſign. And that the Duke made divers Vows to ſtand by them that were engaged in this thing, that they ſhould not want money. That whoever happened to be in priſon, according to their ſtedfastneſs in the Cauſe, all poſſible care ſhould be taken to ſupport and preſerve them. That the Lord</hi> Peterborough <hi>told him he had an opportunity to make his Fortune what he would himſelf, if he would follow the Advice of the Duke of</hi> York, <hi>who would certainly be King in a ſhort time. To which</hi> Dangerfield <hi>anſwered, That he valued not his Life to ſerve the Dukes Intereſt; and then the Earl of</hi> Peterborough <hi>gave him the Title of Captain</hi> Willoughby. <hi>About four days after this, he was with the Duke again, who told him that in a ſhort time he ſhould ſee the Catholick Religion flouriſh in this Kingdom, and Hereſie torn up by the Roots; and that he had heard of the Propoſal made to him by the Lords</hi> Powis <hi>and</hi> Arundel, <hi>about the taking off the King, and alſo of</hi> Dangerfields <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal; and therefore ſaid to</hi> Dangerfield, <hi>If you value the Religion you profeſs, my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, and your own Happineſs, depend upon my Honour for your Advancement. To which</hi> Dangerfield <hi>replied, That he would ſtand and fall in defence of the Roman Catholick Religion, and his Highneſs Service; and that then he was well ſatisfied by his ghoſtly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the King was a condemned Heretick; and therefore he was not a little concern'd that he had refus'd to kill the King: And then ſaid, That if his Highneſs would command him to the Attempt, he would not fail either to loſe his Life or accompliſh it. And Mr.</hi> Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerfield <hi>further ſaith, That the Duke then gave him twenty Guinneys, and ſaid, That if he would be vigorous in what he had undertaken already, he would ſo order it, that his Life ſhould not be in the leaſt danger; adding theſe words, We are not to have men taken in ſuch daring Actions, but to make a quick diſpatch, and be gone.</hi> If you will buy <hi>Dangerfields</hi> Narrative, as it was given in at the Bar of the Houſe of Commons, you may ſee this, and much more.</p>

               <p>Good <hi>City</hi> hold you a little, and let us put in one word, <hi>viz.</hi> This makes us think of the old Saying in our Countrey, that is, <hi>Murder will out.</hi> And truly this is no new wickedneſs, for one Brother to murder another; for the firſt murder that ever was in the World, was the murder of a Brother, for <hi>Cain</hi> murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Brother <hi>Abel.</hi> But pray good <hi>City</hi> go on.</p>

               <p>The Houſe of Lords and the Houſe of Commons have had other Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, wherein there is great diſcoveries of this horrid Plot in <hi>England;</hi> and beſides there is the beginning of a great diſcovery of a damnable Plot in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which we hear will be printed, and then you will ſee all, even <hi>Beelzebub</hi> himſelf in the Plot, againſt our Proteſtant King, and Proteſtant Kingdoms.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Commons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> have declared, <hi>That ſuch as did abhor Ptitioning the King for the Calling and Sitting of the Parliament, are Betrayers of the Rights and Priviledges of Engliſh Subjects.</hi>

               <p>That pleaſeth us to the heart; for we thought it was a grievous thing to be counted Criminals for beſeeching and intreating His Majeſty to do that which we knew would be for His Good as well as ours. And we thought this was the way to make it a crime for Servants to beſeech their Maſters, and Children to deſire their Parents to do thoſe things that are neceſſary for the well-being of the Family.</p>

               <p>Gods bleſſing on their hearts for that; for it is a ſad thing to ſee Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants perſecute Proteſtants. Many good People in the Countrey have been often in Priſon, and received great trouble from the <hi>Biſhops Courts,</hi> and they have born all with great patience, and are ſtill very good Neighbours, and in our Conſciences we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are very good Subjects to His Majeſty: They follow their Employments, they pay Scot and Lot, and other Taxes to the King, and they ſerve God according to their Conſciences, without wronging their fellow Subjects: And to perſecute ſuch, is to pleaſe the Papiſts, and do their work for them, till they have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do it themſelves againſt all Proteſtants, of which theſe are a conſiderable part. But pray good <hi>City</hi> go on with your account.</p>

               <p>Now you tell us a great thing indeed! This is laying the <hi>Proteſtant Ax</hi> to the <hi>Root</hi> of the <hi>Popiſh Tree</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> This indeed is <hi>the onely way</hi> to preſerve us from our <hi>preſent Fears</hi> and <hi>future Dangers.</hi> This makes us think of that Old Saying in our Countrey, <hi>It is good to be ſure:</hi> And verily this is the right way to make all things ſure: Firſt, It maketh ſure of the <hi>Safety of the King;</hi> for the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will not in all likelihood be then ſo haſty to murder him; becauſe if <hi>York</hi> were excluded by Law, they have no other way to ſet him in the Throne, but by the Sword, which after ſo execrable and horrid an Act as that of murdering the King, would be a thouſand times more difficult for them to accompliſh: But as things are now, they would plead his Title by Law, though violence ſhould befal the King, which God of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite mercy prevent. Secondly, This is the way to make ſure of the <hi>Safety of the Proteſtants,</hi> for by this Law their Hearts will be encouraged and their Hands ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened to prevent all deſigned Miſchiefs upon their Perſons, Eſtates, or Religion. But pray let us hear a little more concerning this Bill.</p>
